# Learning Vue.js WIP
I strongly belive you improve the best by building a project yourself. Thats why i started this project :)

For now it's a simple dashboard which displays data from my api-server. (also included in the repo)
I'm trying to aquire more knowledge with Vue and JS in general, so the code could be a little messy. I'm constantly rebuilding my issues / mistakes.

Hopefully i can extend the functionality of this project as time goes.

### Mockups (more to come)
